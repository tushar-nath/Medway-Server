# Medway

Medway is a **Health Management System** that manages individuals' medical histories on a centralised platform, allowing doctors and patients to examine their medical history for future reference.

Users can quickly examine their medical information as well as other information such as the Covid-19 tracker, which highlights the current situation in India regarding covid spread. The user interface, built in *React* Bootstrap, authenticates by email, and data is loaded over *RESTful APIs*. Spring Boot is accessed securely by UI. In the backend, *JAVA* is utilised to fetch and process data, and *Postgres* is used as the database.
